### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my Github page! I am Ainhoa Marticorena. 

<!--<img align="right" alt="img" src="" width="50%" height="auto" /> -->

🎓 I finished my cross-platform application development studies in 2022.

💼 I am currently working in a naval company creating an application for the testing of ships with my teammates. For this application we are learning with #C, WPF and the MVVM pattern.

💖 My hobbies are series, movies, anime and traveling.
